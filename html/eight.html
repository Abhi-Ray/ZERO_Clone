                Apple Watch Series 8 has an innovative sensor that tracks your
                temperature while you sleep, so you can see changes over time.
                Cycle Tracking uses this data to provide a retrospective
                estimate of when you likely ovulated, which can be helpful for
                family planning. When combined with your heart rate and logged
                cycle data, you’ll get a detailed view of your menstrual cycle.

                Period predictions. Less of a question mark. Get improved period
                predictions with wrist temperature data. And receive
                notifications if your logged cycle data shows a possible cycle
                deviation, like irregular or prolonged periods. You can share
                your cycle history with your healthcare provider for more
                informed conversations.5 <br />
                <br />

                Your Cycle Tracking data stays on your device and is encrypted
